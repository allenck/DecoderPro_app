     * Manage tasks to be completed when the
     * program shuts down normally.
     * Specifically, allows other object to
     * register and deregister {@link ShutDownTask} objects,
     * which are invoked in an orderly way when the program is
     * is commanded to terminate.
     * <p>
     * Operations:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Execute each {@link ShutDownTask} in order reverse order of creation,
     *     allowing it to abort the shutdown if needed.
     * <li>If not aborted, terminate the program.
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * There can only be one instance of this operating,
     * and it is generally obtained via the instance manager.
     * <p>
     * Items are executed in reverse order to attempt to unwind the
     * creation process.  Tasks should not count on this, however, as
     * shutdown can be aborted before a particular task is reached.
     * <p>
     * Tasks should leave the system in a state that can continue, in
     * case a later task aborts the shutdown.
     * <p>
     * An instance of this is normally obtained from the instance manager,
     * but using routines should not assume that one is always present; they
     * should check for a null manager and skip operations if needed.
