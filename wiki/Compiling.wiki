<h1>Compiling LocoNetMonitor</h1>
LocoNetMonitor has been developed using QT 4.8.3 although earlier versions should work as well. Qt is available for Linux, Windows, Mac and other
systems. Qt can be downloaded from: [http://qt-project.org/downloads|Qt downloads]. You will also need to download the QtCreator IDE program. 
<p>
The program requires the use of the [http://qt-project.org/wiki/QtSerialPort | QtSerialPort] package which is included in Qt 5.0+ but can be downloaded 
for use with QT 4.x versions. Even though the QtSerialPort module is included with Qt 5.0, it does not, when running on Linux, display
manufacturer or descriptive info. In order to display this info, it is necessary to install the udevlib-dev packagage  ([/doc/tip/DecoderPro_app/wiki/rfid.wiki |instructions])and to download the
current QtSerialPort source (as of August, 2013). As of November, 2013, the QtSerialPort package included with Qt 5.0 provides the nececessary support.</p>
<p>
The program consists of seven projects:
<ol>
   <li><strong>AutoIncreaseBuildNr</strong>This is a little utility program that is used to automatically increment the build number in a c++ header file.</li>
	<li><b>LocoNetMonitor</b> This is the main program. It contains the User Interfaces.</li>
	<li><b>libPr3</b> This project creates a library that contains classes for accessing LocoNet messages and manages configuration data for 
	LocoIO modules. </li>
 <li><strong>ftdilib</strong> This project supports RFID readers that can be obtained from [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11839 | Spark Fun Electronics]</li>
 <li><strong>libLayoutEditor</strong> This project creates a library of routines that are used to create and edit a GUI layout panel.</li>
 <li><strong>libTables</strong> This project creates a library that provides a dialog to display and edit various system tables such as turnouts, sensors, blocks, etc.</li>
 <li><strong>libPrefs</strong> This project creates a library with functions relating to setting and viewing preferences.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>Downloading the source</h2>
The source repository uses Fossil. Fossil can be downloaded for various platforms at 
[http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html | http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html]. Download the program and make it available in your 
path as is appropriate for your operating system. 

To prepare for downloading the source, perform these steps: 
<ol>
	<li>Select a root directory where the source will reside. In my case, I have a directory called 'Projects' although
	it can be any name you choose. </li>
	<li>In the 'Projects' directory, create a directory named 'DecoderPro'. Again, the name you choose for this directory is not important. </li>
	<li>Change to the 'DecoderPro' directory.</li>
	<li>Clone the source repository with the command: '<strong>fossil clone http://acksoft.dyndns.biz:1080/cgi-bin/fossil/DecoderPro decoderpro.fossil</strong>'. 
	This will create a file named 'decoderpro.fossil' which is your local repository copy.</li>
	<li>Next, issue the command '<strong>fossil open decoderpro.fossil</strong>'. 
	This will download the source and other files in the project. It will create a directory 'DecoderPro_app in the '../DecoderPro/' 
	directory containing directories: 'AutoIncreaseBuildNr', 'ftdilib', 'libPr3', 'LocoNetMonitor', 'LayoutEditor', 'Tables' and
	'wiki'.  
	<li>In QtCreator, open the 'AutoIncreaseBuildNr.pro', 'libPr3.pro' and 'LocoNetMonitor.pro' project files in their respective directories. </li>
   <li>Project AutoIncreaseBuildNr should be built first as it is required by the other projects. If you want the optional RFID support, 
   ftdilib must be [/doc/tip/DecoderPro_app/wiki/rfid.wiki |compiled and built]. Then likewise, the library, libPr3 must be compiled before LocoNetMonitor.</li>	
	<li>The source can be updated at any time with any changes since you created the project or last ran 'fossil update' at any time by running '<strong>fossil update</strong>'</li>
</ol>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>On Windows, a USB driver is required. There are instructions in the 
[http://users.telenet.be/deloof/Locobuffer/LocoBuffer%20EN.pdf|LocoBuffer Manual] on how to do this.
