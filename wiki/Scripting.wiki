<h1>Scripting</h1>

Scripting support requires installation of PytonQt. I am using
version 3.2 (PythonQt-master) which has wrappers for Qt version 5.6. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonqt/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonqt/files/</a>.
Here is a brief overview of using PythonQt: <a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq23-pythonqt.html">https://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq23-pythonqt.html</a><br>

<br>

<h2>Wrappers</h2>

<br>

C++ classes that will be available to be used by PythonQt must have
Python wrapper functions generated using the PythonQt <span style="font-style: italic;">pythonqt_generator</span> application. Two
files must be supplied to <span style="font-style: italic;">pythonqt_generator</span>:
<br>

<ol>

  <li>A wrapper header file including #include statements for all the
headers needed by classes which will be wrapped. This file is in the
LayoutEditor folder and is called '<span style="font-style: italic;">wrappers.h</span>'.</li>
  <li>An Xml file listing all the classes to be wrapped: This file is
also in the LayoutEditor folder and is called '<span style="font-style: italic;">typesystem_jmri.xml</span>'</li>
</ol>

In addtion, in the LayoutEditor folder can be found the Unix script
file '<span style="font-style: italic;">generate_mypackage.sh'</span>.
Of course, if you are using Windows, a suitable BAT file must be
created instead. <br>

<br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">pythonqt_generator</span> app
when run will create all the wrappers in the LayoutEditor/jmri folder.
The wrapper functions are then compiled with LayoutEditor. This script
also specifies the QT version (the lastest QT wrappers in PythonQt are
for QT version 5.6 so use that QT version) and which version of
PythonQt which will be used to generate the wrapper functions.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">pythonqt_generator </span>app must be run whenever one of the following is true:<br>
<ol>
  <li>New functions or classes are added to those that PythonQt can use.</li>
  <li>New methods are added or modified to existing classes. Note that
all classes' methods that are to be be useable by PythonQt scripts must be
declared as 'public:'! <br>
  </li>
</ol>
