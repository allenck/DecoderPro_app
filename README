<pre><br>This repository contains a port of the Java JMRI Model Railroad
Interface software to QT (C++).
<br>The majority of JMRI code has been ported except only Digitrax
(LocoNet) and SProg hardware is supported.<br>
In addition, scripting and Audio support still needs more work.<br>
<br>
This project was started because I wanted better support for the LocoIO
series of boards so users of that hardware might find this port of
interest. <br>
<br>Scripting support requires that Python and Python Qt be installed.
Also, zip files require the Quazip package be installed. <br>
<br>Although this project was started using Qt 4, recent development has
been using Qt 5.
<br>The addition of WebServer support requires that QT version 5.6 or
laterbe used. Current development has been with Qt 5.11.3<br></pre>
