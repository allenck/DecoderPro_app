This repository contains a port of the Java JMRI Model Railroad Interface software to QT (C++).
The majority of JMRI code has been ported except only Digitrax (LocoNet) and SProg hardware is supported.
In addition, scripting and Audio support still needs more work.

This project was started because I wanted better support for the LocoIO series of boards so users of that hardware might find this port of interest. 

Scripting support requires that Python and Python Qt be installed. Also, zip files require the Quazip package be installed. 

Although this project was started using Qt 4, recent development has been using Qt 5.
The addition of WebServer support requires that QT version 5.6 or laterbe used. Current development has been with Qt 5.11.3
