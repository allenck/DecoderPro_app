This repository contains a port of the Java JMRI Model Railroad Interface software to QT (C++). The majority of JMRI code has been ported except only Digitrax (LocoNet) hardware is supported. In addition, scripting and Audio support still needs more work. 

This project was started because I wanted better support for the LocoIO series of boards so users of that hardware might find this port of interest. 

Scripting support requires that Python and Python Qt be installed. Also, zip files require the Quazip package be installed. 

This code should run OK under Qt 4 and Qt 5 up to version 5.4. Most of the development has been done on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows support has not been tested extensively.
