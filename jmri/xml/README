The xml/ directory contains DTDs defining various model railroad constructs, 
XML files describing various types of model railroad equipment, and
some sample XML files. 

Currently, these are defined via DTDs. We intend to move to schema eventually,
particularly to pick up validity checking.

Subdirectories:

	decoders - Files describing specific families of DCC decoders

	programmers - Files describing specific displays for the DecoderPro
	              symbolic decoder programmer
	              
	DTD - contains DTD definitions for all XML files
	
Certain configuration files appear in the top-level directory:

	decoderIndex.xml - associations between manufacturers, mfg codes,
		decoder models and families
		
	names.xml - definition of standard names for use in 
		the programmer files

The JMRI web page is located at http://jmri.sourceforge.net/

More information on these configuration file is available at
