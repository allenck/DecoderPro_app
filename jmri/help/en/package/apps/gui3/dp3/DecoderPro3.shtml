<h1>Introduction to Decoder Pro 3</h1>

<p><b>THIS HELP FILE IS WORK IN PROGRESS </b>. Please help JMRI by contributing
to improve this help file ! </p>

<p>Decoder Pro 3 presents a list of your locomotives (the Roster) and provides
access to tools for programming decoder configuration variables (CV's). </p>

<h1>Description of Decoder Pro 3 Window</h1>

<p>The Decoder Pro 3 Window is divided into five main sections from top to
bottom. </p>
<img src="helpfile_dump1.jpg" width="526" height="266">

  <li><a href="#menubar">The Menu Bar</a>. </li>
  <li><a href="#toolbar">The Tool Bar (or Button Bar). Containing buttons and
    controls.</a> </li>
  <li>The Roster Table. Containing a list of decoders in your Roster. An entry
    in the Roster can be highlighted with the mouse. </li>
  <li>The Decoder Information Area. This shows information about the
    highlighted entry in the Roster table. </li>
  <li>A status bar. This reports information in a single line. Error
    information is also posted here.</li>

<h1>Main Tasks with Decoder Pro 3</h1>

<p>Decoder Pro 3 is designed for the management of DCC decoders fitted to
locomotives. The locomotives known to Decoder Pro 3 are displayed in the Roster
Table. The anticipated main tasks are: creating a new locomotive and changing
the settings in an existing locomotive (programming). </p>

<h2>New Locomotive</h2>

<p>To add a new locomotive (or first locomotive), click on the "New Loco"
button on the Tool Bar. This will open a "Create New Loco" window, where the
decoder can be either identified or selected from the list. To create the
locomotive, having selected (or identified) a decoder, select the Programmer
format (Basic or Comprehensive) and click "Open Programmer". A Programming
window for the new locomotive will open, with the "Roster Entry" tab foremost.
It is recommended to give the locomotive a name in the "ID:" field, and then
click "Save to Roster". You can also proceed to program the decoder, giving it
a DCC address (in the "Basic" tab), and set other values. On closing the
Programming window, if prompted, save the results into the Roster. </p>

<h2>Identify Existing Locomotive</h2>

<p>If a locomotive is placed on the Programming Track, the "Identify" button
will read details from the decoder and try to match it to an entry in the
Roster Table. Some decoders only work with a limited range of programming
modes, and it may be necessary to change the programming mode with the "Set"
button. If a locomotive is correctly identified, it will be highlighted in the
Roster Table, and its details will appear in the lower Decoder Information
Area. </p>

<h2>Programming an existing Locomotive</h2>

<p>Once a locomotive has been selected, either by manually finding it within
the Roster Table, or through the "Identify" button, a summary of its details
will appear in the lower Decoder Information Area. Buttons to open the
programmer are to the right of the Decoder Information Area. </p>

<p>Select the type of programming required with the radio buttons, choose
between the Programming Track, Programming on the Main Line or Edit the file
only (no programming of a locomotive). Having selected the type of programming,
you can open either the Basic Programmer (which allows change of locomotive
address) or the Comprehensive Programmer (which allows changing of all
locomotive decoder features known to DecoderPro). </p>

<h2>Changing Throttle Labels and Roster Media</h2>

<p>Throttle Labels are used by the JMRI on-screen Throttles and by the
smart-phone throttles through the WiThrottle interface. They allow Function
keys to have meaningful names such as "Horn", "Whistle", rather than "F2" and
"F4". Their use is optional. </p>

<p>Roster Media is where pictures of locomotives can be loaded into JMRI. These
are displayed in the Roster, and can be used within Throttles. Their use is
optional. </p>

<h2>Roster Groups</h2>

<p>Roster Groups are a means of filtering your entries in the Roster. For
example, you might have "diesel locos", "steam locos", but also "Burlington
Locos" and "Canadian Pacific Locos". Thus a single locomotive in the Roster
could be a member of several groups. Roster Groups are used to filter the
Roster View in Decoder Pro 3, and select the locomotives offered in an
on-screen Throttle. </p>

<p>To create your first Roster Group, use the "Create Roster Group" command on
the "Settings" menu. When you have created a Roster Group, a new drop-list is
added to the Tool Bar in Decoder Pro 3. Having created a group, it is initially
empty. The next step is to add locomotives to the group. This is done with the
"Roster Group Table Association" command on the "Settings" menu. With the
"Roster Group Table" window, select the Roster Group in the drop-menu, and then
place a tick alongside all locomotives requires in that group. Repeat for any
other groups, and when finished close the window with the close-box in the
upper right-hand corner. </p>

<h2>Command Station Specific menu</h2>

<p>A menu will appear for the command station connected to JMRI. The command
station is set in the Preferences. The content of this menu will be specific to
your command station. </p>

<h2>Window menu</h2>

<p>Lists the windows that are currently active. </p>

<h2>Help menu</h2>

<p>Opens this panel. </p>
<a name="toolbar"></a> 

<h1>Tool Bar</h1>

<h2>Help button</h2>

<p>Opens this panel. </p>

<h2>New Loco button</h2>

<p>Opens Service Mode Programmer Decoder selection Screen. </p>

<h2>Identify button</h2>

<p>Attempts to identify the loco on the Programing track. </p>

<h2>Programming mode Set button</h2>

<p>Opens the selection of programing modes. </p>

<h1>Roster Group Pane</h1>

<p>The Roster Group Pane only appears if a Roster Group has been defined. 
The pane appears to the left of the Roster Table.  Further groups can be added
using the "+" button, and groups can be removed with the "-" button.  Locos can
be dragged from the Roster Table to the Roster Group Pane. The Roster Group Pane
can be hidden with a menu option (under Settings), or with the triangular 
shrink/expand keys in the frame border.  At present, removing a loco from a Roster
Group can only be done with the "Roster Group Table Associations" window, accessible
from the "Settings" menu.  <i>Note that the Roster Group Pane
feature is somewhat experimental development and comments on its design and extending
the functionality are sought</i>.</p>
