The CBUS event capture tool can simplify
configuring JMRI to work well with your 
<A href="../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.html">CBUS</a>
installation.

<p>
To 
<a href="../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.html">configure JMRI sensors and turnouts</a>,
you need to identify the associated CBUS events. There are several ways to do this. 
The rest of this page goes through the alternatives, using configuring a sensor
as an example.  Similar methods work for turnouts.

<h3>Provide the Event ID</h3>
    
You can just type an 
<A href="../../../../../../../html/hardware/can/cbus/index.html">event ID</a>
in the field next to
"Active On", and then press "Create".  A sensor will be created that
goes active when the event is seen, and inactive when the opposite event (ON vs OFF)
is seen.

<p>
If you want to associate active and inactive with completely separate events,
you can enter the event IDs in the two fields and click "Create".


<h3>Capture the Next Event</h3>
    
If you can make the layout emit the 
desired event, for example by pressing a fascia switch or
throwing a turnout, you can capture that event
and use it.
<p>
If you press the "Capture Next" button next to one of the
event fields, it will stay down (activated) until the next
CBUS event (CAN frame) is seen by the program.  
That event is captured into the neighboring field for later use.

<p>
You can separately
capture the two events for a sensor if desired.


<h3>Examine Multiple Events</h3>
    
The upper part of the screen can capture
multiple CBUS events, which you can then use to 
create sensors and turnouts.

<p>
When a new CBUS message comes it, it will be captured 
in the highest line that has the "Capture" box checked.
The box will then be unchecked so 
the captured message is not 
overwritten by later CBUS messages.
If you check a series of boxes, you can capture 
a series of messages.

<p>
Once you've captured the event you want, you can 
copy and paste it into the boxes in the lower part of the 
window.  If your computer allows it, you can 
also just drag and drop the value into the lower field.

<h3>Other Tools</h3>

Once you've created a sensor or turnout, you can
use the 
<a href="../../../../../jmrit/beantable/SensorTable.shtml">Sensor Table</a>
or
<a href="../../../../../jmrit/beantable/TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a>
to adjust the details.

<p>
The 
<a href="../console/CbusConsoleFrame.shtml">CBUS Console</a>
can help you figure out what events are happening on your layout.
