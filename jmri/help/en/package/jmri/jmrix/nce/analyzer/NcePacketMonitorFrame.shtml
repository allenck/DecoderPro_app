			<P>The NCE DCC Packet Analyzer tool works with the
			<a href="https://ncedcc.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200979515-Packet-Analyzer" target= "_blank">NCE Packet Analyzer<a/>
			product to read and present the DCC packets on your track.
			It connects via a separate serial port from your 
			command station connection.</P>
			<P>If you do not have an NCE system, configure a new second connection in <a href="/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Connections" target="_blank">Preferences->Connections</a> to "NCE Simulator" so you can access the NCE "DCC Packet Analyzer" menu item. If you do this, you will need to restart JMRI and then open <a href="/help/en/manual/DecoderPro/Start_Preferences.shtml#Defaults" target="_blank">Preferences->Defaults</a> to check that the NCE Simulator has not "stolen" any of your real connections.</P>

<h2>Using the Analyzer</h2>
Select the "Serial port:" and push the "Open" button before using any of the
radio buttons. The baud rate is fixed at 38.4Kbps. If nothing appears on the
screen immediately, select a new display mode (e.g. "Verbose") and some packet types
to display (e.g. "Idle Packets").

<P>Use the radio buttons to configure the analyzer to your liking.
Note that the NCE analyzer will remember the configuration when it is
powered down.</P>

<P>The "+ on" checkbox allows you to suppress identical packets.
Each time the JMRI program detects a packet that it identical to the
previous it will replace the packet with a "+" character. Warning, the
JMRI program will only display the suppressed packets ("+" characters)
after receiving a packet that isn't identical to the previous. If
there's little activity it is recommended that you not use the suppress
feature. This way you will immediately see all packets being captured by
the analyzer.</P>

<P>The "Info" button will cause the analyzer to display its inbuilt help screen and the Analyzer version number. Press the "Res." button to resume normal operation.</P>
