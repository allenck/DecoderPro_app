<H1>Edit NCE Macro</H1>
This tool allows you to review, edit, and save NCE style macros. It also
allows you to backup and restore all the NCE command station macros to
and from a file. The file format is identical to NCE, so you can restore
a file that was generated by the NCE backup command. Very useful since
the restore and backup commands in the 2007 EPROM don't currently
work! We recommend that you set the baud rate at 9600 when using this
tool.

<H2>Backup</H2>

To backup all of your macros to a file, press the "Backup" button
located on the bottom row of the JMRI macro editor. A default file name
will appear in the Save window, you can change the name it to whatever
you wish. Press the "Save" button and the JMRI macro editor will read
the NCE command station memory and store the contents into the file you
selected.

<H2>Restore</H2>

To restore all of your macros from a file, press the "Restore" button
located on the bottom row of the JMRI macro editor. Select a file by
typing the name, or clicking on it. Press the "Open" button and the JMRI
macro editor will write the NCE command station memory with the contents
of the file you selected. The JMRI macro editor will check the contents
of the file before writing the command station memory to verify that the
file is indeed a NCE macro backup file!

<H2>Get</H2>

To review a macro, enter the number of the macro in the text box under
the heading "Macro" and press the "Get" button. This will retrieve the
macro from the command station's memory. If there's currently a macro,
the "Reply:" will be "macro found". If the macro doesn't exist, the
"Reply:" will be "macro empty". If there is a macro, the JMRI NCE editor
will show a list of accessories that the macro is programmed to
activate.
<P>To change an accessory address, type in a new accessory address
and press the button next to the accessory address box to "Closed" or
"Thrown". If you want to save it to the NCE command station you must
press the "Save" button located at the bottom of the editor. The "Save"
button only becomes active if the macro has been modified.</P>

<H2>Add</H2>

To add an accessory to a macro, enter the accessory's address and then
press the "Add" button until the desired action "Thrown" or "Closed"
appears. Again, use the "Save" button if you wish to update the NCE
command station memory.

<H2>Delete</H2>

To delete an accessory, push the "Delete" button across from the
accessory you wish to delete. And "Save" if you want to update the NCE
command station memory.

<H2>Link macro</H2>

To link this macro to another one, enter the macro that you want to link
to in the last text box of the JMRI NCE editor. Press the "Link macro"
button and "Save" if you want to update the NCE command station memory.
To delete the link, press "Delete" and "Save".

<H2>Previous and Next</H2>

The "Previous" and "Next" buttons allow you to search for macros. If
you're looking for an empty macro, click the "Empty Macro" box located
in the upper right hand corner. And finally, if you're a diehard NCE fan
and just can't stand using the terms "Thrown" and "Closed" to describe a
turnout, click the "NCE Turnout" box and the accessory buttons will
become "Normal" and "Reverse" just like your NCE throttle!
