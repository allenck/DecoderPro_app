<H1>The Image Index Editor</H1>

This window is used to create an Image Index.  The index may be organized
according to any taxonomy you wish.  Using it allows you to access any
image file that is accessible from your computer without moving or copying
the file.  It is similar to a table of contents or index that you might 
find in a reference textbook. 


<H2>Contents of the Image Index Editor</H2>
<img src="ImageIndex.png" align="right">
<p>
The window contains two panes side by side.  The left side is your current 
Image Catalog.  This is what the Icon Editors have been using to change
icons.  The top panel of this pane consists of one or more trees.  The default tree
is "Program Directory", the catalog of all the image files downloaded with the
version of JMRI you are using.  These are files that were encapsulated in "jmri.jar".
Another default tree may be "Preferences Directory", the catalog of all the image 
files contained in the "resources" directory in your JMRI preferences directory.
If you have not created a "resources" directory in your JMRI preferences directory
you will not see this tree.  Other trees that you may see are those that you have
installed after using the <b>Open File System Directory</b> menu item in one of the Icon Editor 
windows and pressed the <b>Add to Catalog</b> button there.  (The "Add to Catalog" 
button does not appear in this window.)  Below the trees is a "Preview"
pane that displays the images found in any node that you have selected from
one of the above trees.  "Nodes" are the folder icons that appear when you click on 
the handle to the left of a folder icon.  Clicking on a node will open a pane
that displays the icons contained in the node. 
</p>
<p>The "Preview" pane has a label that states how many image files are referenced in the node.  
Beneath each image (icon) is a label that states the "scale" at which the 
image is displayed.   Below the icons
are radio buttons that provide three background for the icons.  This may
help you determine what parts of the icon are opaque and what parts are transparent.</p>
<p>
The right side is the <b>Image Index</b> you may edit.  It is similar to the left pane
in that the top panel is the tree of the Index you are creating.  Likewise, the 
bottom panel displays the
images found in any node of the tree that you select.  Initially, there will be just one
node labeled "Image Index".  You are able to add additional nodes to this node by using the 
menus below.
</p>


<H2>The Menus</H2>

<p>The <b>Find Icons</b> menu has two items:
<UL>
        <LI><b>Store ImageIndex</b>.  This stores a permanent record of the Image Index
        that will be restored the next time the Panel Editor is opened.  The
        Image Index will be included in the Catalog trees used by the
        Icon Editors.<p></p></LI>
        
        <LI><b>Open a File System Directory</b>.  This opens a file chooser dialog where
        you may open any directory that that has image files.  To open the directory,
        select any image file contained in it and a window will attempt to display all 
        the image files found in the directory.
        <p>See  
        <a href="../display/IconAdder.shtml">Icon Editors</a> for more details on this
        menu item.</p>
        <p>The icons displayed in the "preview" panel of any directory window opened
        from this menu item can be added 
        to the Image Index.  How to do this is described below.
</UL>
<p>The <b>Edit</b> menu has three items:
<UL>
        <LI><b>Add Node</b>.  First select a node in the Image Index tree.  Then, use this
        menu item to add a sub-node the the selected node.  A "sub-node" is a node that 
        branches from under the selected node.</LI> 
        <LI><b>Delete Node</b>.  First select a node in the Image Index tree.  Then, use this
        menu item to delete the node.  Since this will also delete the nodes and icon
        references that branch off from under this node, a confirmation dialog is opened
        with the total of all the items that will be deleted.</LI> 
        <LI><b>Rename Node</b>.  First select a node in the Image Index tree.  Then, use this
        menu item to change the name of the node.</LI> 
</UL>

<H2>Adding Icons to the Image Index</H2>

<p>Use "Drag and Drop" to copy an icon from either the Catalog pane (left pane) or a File 
Directory window.  Press the mouse button down on any icon appearing in the "preview"
panel of either of these windows to "drag" the icon to a node of the Image Index tree 
(right pane).  (Dragging means holding the mouse button down as you move the mouse
pointer to a node of the Image Index tree.)
Actually, it is only the reference to the location of the icon that is saved by the 
Image Index.  As long the file remains in place, it will be displayed by the Catalog, the
Image Index and your Panel (if you have installed it there).
</p>

<H2>Deleting and Renaming icons in the Image Index</H2>

<p>Pressing and releasing (clicking) the mouse button over an icon in the preview pane
of the Image Index activatea a "pop-up" menu.
Pop-Up menus display the name and reference
location of the icon.  The pop-up also provides items to modify icons in the Image Index.</p>
<UL>
        <LI><b>Rename Icon</b> opens a dialog box where a new name can be entered.</LI>
        <LI><b>Delete Icon</b> removes the icon from the Image Index node.</LI>
        
        <p>Note: <i>the "preview" panel will only show these changes
        after leaving the node and then returning to the node.</i>
</UL>
