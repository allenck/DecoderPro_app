<H1>Sensor Groups
</H1>
   
The Sensor Group tool window allows you to define Sensor Groups, 
a group of sensors of which at most one can be active.  
When a member of the group becomes active, all others are set to inactive.
<P>
Generally, you would use something like this to simulate a rotary switch
on a real control panel.  The real switch would activate only one input
as it was turned from position to position; the previous input would become
inactive as the switch turned to the next position.  On a PanelPro
control panel, each position might be shown by a separate sensor icon
which you click to activate.  Putting that set of sensors in a Sensor Group
would then cause the sensor at the previous position to go inactive when
you clicked to change the simulated rotary switch.
<P>
To define a group:
<UL>
<LI>Check the "Included" box next to each sensor that you want to 
include in the group.  You can click on the titles at the top of the 
columns to sort them if you have lots of sensors to flip through.
<LI>Put a unique sensor group name in the box at the bottom. No particular
format is required, but it can't duplicate one you've already defined.
<LI>Click add/update
</UL>
<P>
To see a Sensor Group you've already defined, put it's name in the
Group Name box, and click View.  You can then change the checkboxes to
add or remove sensors from the group, and click Add/Update to make 
your changes.
<P>
Remember to save your changes to a new configuration or panel file before
quitting the program!
