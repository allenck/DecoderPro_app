<H1>Turnout Control</H1>

Enter the accessory number or turnout system name for the accessory or
turnout you wish to control in the box to right of "turnout:". For
example, entering 678 and by pressing either the Thrown or Closed
button, you should be able to change the state of accessory number 678
on the layout. Another example, a valid turnout system name for NCE
could be NT456. Then by pressing either the Thrown or Closed button, you
should be able to change the state of turnout or accessory number 456 on
the layout. Another example, a valid turnout system name could be IT123
which is internal turnout number 123. Pressing Thrown or Closed will
only change the state of the internal turnout and will not change a
turnout on the layout. 
See "<A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</A>" 
under general help for more information.

<H2>Turnout Control Buttons and Status</H2>

<DL>
	<DT>current state:</DT>
	<DD>Shows the current known state of the turnout. A turnout can
	have four states: unknown, inconsistent, thrown, and closed. The
	unknown state is when JMRI doesn't know if the turnout is thrown or
	closed. The inconsistent state is when a turnout on the layout is
	commanded to throw or close but the feedback from the layout hasn't
	been received. Also note that the inconsistent state can only occur if
	a turnout has feedback. The thrown and closed states are what the JMRI
	program knows or believes is the state of the turnout.</DD>

	<DT>feedback mode:</DT>
	<DD>Shows the turnout's feedback mode. Some of the available <A
		HREF="#Feedback">feedback</A> modes are: DIRECT, ONE SENSOR, TWO
	SENSOR, and MONITORING. A turnout using DIRECT mode doesn't have
	feedback from the layout. When a close or throw command is executed the
	JMRI program assumes that the command always completes. ONE SENSOR use
	one sensor on the layout to provide feedback on the state of the
	turnout. TWO SENSOR uses two sensors for feedback, one for closed and
	one for thrown. MONITORING gets feedback from the system by either
	listening to cab commands on the layout or polling the system for
	turnout status. See the
	<A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/TurnoutFeedback.shtml">turnout feedback page</A>
	for more information.</DD>

	<DT>Thrown</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to throw the turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Closed</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to close the turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Cab operation:</DT>
	<DD>Some turnouts can be locked. If the control button is grayed
	out, the lock feature isn't available. See the
    <A HREF="#NCETurnoutLockFeature">NCE Turnout lock feature</A>
    below.</DD>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="NCETurnoutLockFeature"></A>NCE Turnout lock feature</H3>

<P>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a turnout, the JMRI
program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it detects a
change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately by
sending out the opposite command to the turnout.</P>
<P>To use this feature you must select MONITORING as the feedback
mode for the turnout and the NCE command station must have the 2007 or
newer EPROM.</P>
<P>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can be
locked. All turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and
are included in the route will be locked.</P>
