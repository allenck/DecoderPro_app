<H1>Roster Speed Profiling</H1>
    
<p>The tool is designed to create a profile of a loco at various speed steps to help with the automatic running of a loco within JMRI.  Primarily to help with the principle of getting a loco to stop within a specific distance from a known throttle setting.</p>
<p>The tool works on the principle of timing a loco over a known distance at a given speed step, in both the forward and reverse direction.  Currently it requires three sensors which monitor the occupancy of a section of track.  Ideally the section of track that the timed runs are performed over should be straight, and a minimum of 1mtr long, the longer the length the better the result.  For this profiling to work correctly acceleration/deacceleration should be disabled on the loco decoder.</p>
<b>Requirements</b><ul>
<li><b>Block Length</b> - This is the length in Millimetres of the middle section which the timed run will be measured.</li>
<li><b>Start Sensor</b> - This is the initial section of track that the loco will start its initial run from.</li>
<li><b>Block Sensor</b> - This is the sensor related to the section of track that the timed run will be taken over</li>
<li><b>Finish Sensor</b> - This sensor related to the section track immediately after the timed section.</li>
<li><b>Roster Entry</b> - Select the loco that the profiling is to be performed on.</li>
<li><b>Cancel</b> - Cancels the profiling or test run</li>
<li><b>Profile</b> - Starts the profiling</li>
<li><b>View</b> - Opens a table of the speed profile</li>
</ul>
<p>To profile the loco, fill the above details into the window, place the loco in the starting section facing forwards towards (but not on) the section of track that the timed run will be taken over, then press profile.</p>
<p>What happens is that the tool will set the loco off running in the forward direction at speed step 1, when it activates the timed section sensor it starts a timer.  Once the finish section sensor is activated the timer is stopped, and the speed is calculated in Millimetres per Second, this is then recorded against the roster.  The tool will then ensure that the loco is clear of the timed section sensor, then repeat the procedure again but in the reverse direction.  Once the loco is back at the initial start section, the whole procedure is repeated again for the next speed step, this occurs until a profile of all speed steps has been completed.</p>
<p>Profiles can be made with fewer speed steps by choosing the steps to start and end on, and how many steps to increment to the next sampling step.  
When a starting step is larger than 4 be sure to place the loco in a position that will allow it to achieve full speed before reaching the block sensor. 
<p>The "Update Profile" radio button (default) merges whatever profiling has been done with the existing speed profile in the Roster.  The "Clear Profile" 
radio button overwrites any existing speed profile.</p>
<H3>Testing</H3>
Having completed the profiling, it is possible to test the profile out.  Place the loco in the starting section again facing forward toward the timed section, ideally some distance away from it.  Enter in a starting speed step number in the box next to the Test Button, then press test.  What will occur is that the tool will set the loco off running at the given speed step, then it will attempt to gradually stop the loco before it reaches the far end.  Results will vary especially at the higher speed steps, where you will more likely experience an over run.</p>
<H3>Viewing</h3>
 The table displayed by the View button shows the speeds attained by the loco for each throttle step in both directions.  The default speeds are in millimeters per second
 of the layout track speed.  These values can be converted to scale speeds by selecting either of the "Miles per Hour" or "Kilometers per Hour" radio buttons
 on the Warrants panel of Preferences.  The Factor column is the ratio of track speed (mm/sec) to throttle setting (0.0 to 1.0).</p>
