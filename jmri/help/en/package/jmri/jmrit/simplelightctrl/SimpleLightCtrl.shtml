<H1>Light Control</H1>

Enter the light system name for the
light you wish to control in the box to right of "light:". For
example, entering 678 and by pressing either the On or Off
button, you should be able to change the state of light number 678
on the layout. Another example, a valid light system name for PowerLine devices
could be PL9. Then by pressing either the On or Off button, you
should be able to change the state of light on
the layout. Another example, a valid light system name could be IL123
which is internal light number 123. Pressing On or Off will
only change the state of the internal light and will not change a
light on the layout. See "
<A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.shtml">Names</A>
" under general help for more information.

<H2>Light Control Buttons and Status</H2>

<DL>
	<DT>Current State:</DT>
	
	<DD>Shows the current known state of the light.</DD>
		<DL>
			<DT>&lt;Unknown&gt;</DT>
			<DD>Either no light selected or invalid light name.</DD>
			<DT>Off</DT>
			<DD>Light is at minimum intensity if variable intensity supported, or off.</DD>
			<DT>On</DT>
			<DD>Light is at maximum intensity if variable intensity supported, or full on.</DD>
			<DT>Intermediate</DT>
			<DD>
				Light intensity is between 0 and 100% and the current intensity is equal to
				the target intensity.
			</DD>
			<DT>Transitioning Higher</DT>
			<DD>
				Target intensity is higher than the current intensity and light is adjusting
				every fast minute according to Transition Time value.
			</DD>
			<DT>Transitioning Lower</DT>
			<DD>
				Target intensity is lower than the current intensity and light is adjusting
				every fast minute according to Transition Time value.
			</DD>
			<DT>Transitioning to Full On</DT>
			<DD>
				Target intensity is higher than the current intensity,
				and equal or higher than maximum intensity and light is adjusting
				every fast minute according to Transition Time value.
			</DD>
			<DT>Transitioning to Full Off</DT>
			<DD>
				Target intensity is lower than the current intensity,
				and equal or lower than minimum intensity and light is adjusting
				every fast minute according to Transition Time value.
			</DD>
		</DL>
	</DD>
	
	<DT>Configuration Options of Lights:</DT>
	<DD>
		<DL>
		<DT>Enabled:</DT>
			<DD>The light will respond to its automatic control type.</DD>
		<DT>Variable:</DT>
			<DD>Light may be commanded to values between 0% and 100%.</DD>
		<DT>Transitional:</DT>
			<DD>Changes of intensity will use the transition time to step
				between current and target intensity.
			</DD>
		</DL>
	</DD>

	<DT>On</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to turn on the light.</DD>

	<DT>Off</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to turn off the light.</DD>

	<DT>Change Intensity</DT>
	<DD>Enter a new value for the light (0% to 100%) and pressing
		this button will set the new target intensity.
		If transitional is supported if will use the transition
		time for computing how fast to move from current intensity
		to the new target intensity.
	</DD>
	
	<DT>Minimum Intensity:</DT>
	<DD>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the lowest amount of light that
	will be output by a dim command.
	An explicit off command will ignore this value.
	</DD>
	
	<DT>Maximum Intensity:</DT>
	<DD>A value 0 to 100 (percent) that sets the highest amount of light that
	will be output by a dim command.
	An explicit on command will ignore this value.
	</DD>
	
	<DT>Transition Time:</DT>
	<DD>
	   Number of fast minutes to go from 0% to 100% intensity.
	   A value of zero will cause the device to change from one intensity
	   to new intensity as fast as the device is able to do so.
	</DD>
