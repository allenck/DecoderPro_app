<h4>Import locomotives
from a File&nbsp;</h4><h4 style="font-weight: normal;">The import from file function requires an ACSII text file, with one
line for each locomotive. The import order is locomotive number,
locomotive road name, locomotive model, and locomotive length. The
following shows two examples of the correct format:
</h4><p>236 UP RS4 40 <br>
5578 SP SW1200 42</p>
<p>Each line can start with a space and multiple spaces between
fields
is okay. Optionally you can include additional information in the
following order, owner name, date built, and location. The location can
have two fields, the location name followed by the location's siding or
yard name separated by a hyphen. The following shows two examples of
the correct format:</p>
<br>
236 UP RS4 40 AT 1930 Home Town USA - locomotive Terminal <br>
5578 SP SW1200 42 DB 1934 York - York locomotive Yard
<p>If you prefer to use comma delimiters instead of spaces, place
the
word "comma" at the start of your import file and use commas instead of
spaces. The following are two examples of importing locomotives with
comma deliminters.</p>
<p>comma <br>
236,UP,RS 4,40,AT,1930,Home Town USA,-,locomotive Terminal <br>
5578,SP,SW 1200,42,DB,1934,Town of York,-,York locomotive Yard</p>
<p>You need to be very careful with spaces when importing a comma
delimitated file. The program will include leading and trailing spaces
if they exist between the commas.</p>
<p> Note that the program will only add locomotives that don't
exist in
the program's locomotive roster. If the locomotive already exists, it
will be skipped by the program.</p>
<p>After importing your locomotives, you must save them if you
want to
keep them as part of your roster then edit themto add missing attributes.</p><p><img style="width: 799px; height: 256px;" alt="engine roster" src="images/Ops_EngineRoster.png"> </p><p>These engines were imported from your file, so we will need
to
edit them to set&nbsp;missing attribute that are required: &nbsp;Length , Consist, Location as required.<br>&nbsp;<a href="Ops_EditEngines.shtml"><strong>Edit button</strong></a> in the Edit column will open the Edit Locomotives window &nbsp;and allow you to edit locomotive attributes..</p><p><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="Ops_SetEngines.shtml">Set button</a> in the Set&nbsp;column for each locomotive in the &nbsp;roster will allow you to set the location.</p><hr><p></p>
