<H2>JMRI: Entry Exit (NX) Routing Documentation</H2>

<h3>What is Entry/Exit (NX) Routing?</h3>

<p>NX Routing, builds a dynamic valid path between two locations on a Layout Editor 
such as sensors or signal masts.  The path can traverse a number of turnouts 
and different blocks.  The entry and exit locations on the Layout Editor are 
defined by the placement of sensors at various block boundaries.  When two sensors 
are activated and a clear and valid route is found between them, then the turnouts 
in the route will automatically be set accordingly.
<p>
If there are multiple paths between two locations, then the system will use the 
path with the smallest cost or number of different blocks.  If one on the blocks on the 
path is already occupied and there is a valid alternative path, then this will be taken.
<p>
<h3>How to setup for Entry Exit Routing:</h3>

First you will need to have built a representation of your layout in the 
layout editor, blocks will also need be defined so that the sensors can be 
assigned to the boundary.

<h3>Placing Sensors</h3>
Sensors can be placed by turnouts, anchor points and level crossings, 
but only where there is a boundary between two different layout blocks.<br>
To add a sensor right click on the turnout, level crossing or anchor point 
and if a block boundary exists you will be given the option to "Set Sensors..." 
You can also set sensors at End Bumpers or Buffer Stops.
<p>
You will then be presented with a fresh window that allows you to select 
the sensor that will be used to either "protect" or be on the boundary of block x & y.<br>
The boundary or the protecting block selected will define which direction the 
sensors is active in.

<p>
In the example above, the sensor protecting block 51 will be used
for routes going in an easterly direction. While the sensor 
protecting block 50, will be used for routes going in a westerly direction.<p>

For turnouts and crossings, you can only add a sensors for the boundary 
going into the turnout or crossing, it is not possible to add a sensor 
for the boundary going out from the turnout or crossing.<br>
e.g., If block A is the section of track attached to the turnout and the 
turnout is in block B, you can only add a sensor that faces into block A 
that protects block B, you cannot add a sensor that faces into block B to 
protect block A.

<h3>Generating Entry Exit Pairs</h3>
You can have the system automatically generate the basic Entry Exit pairs and also it is possible 
to manually add pairs in the system, along with adding in what would normally be considered invalid 
configuration.

To access the Entry Exit panel, select "Entry Exit" from the tools menu of the layout editor. 
You will then be presented with the following screen...
<p>

<p>
If you press the <b>Auto Generate Entry Exit Pairs</b> this will then discover all the 
valid entry exit pairs on the layout.<br>
Using the combo boxes it is also possible to manually add in additional Entry Exit pairs.<br>
In all cases when the <b>From</b> sensor is set active followed by the <b>To</b> sensor, the 
route will be set between those two points and the two sensors will return back to the inactive state. 
If the <b>Both Way</b> option is ticked, then it is possible to activate the route in either direction, 
i.e. you can select the To sensor prior to the From sensor and the same route will be set.
<p>
<h3>Limitation</h3>
The Entry Exit currently only deals with the throwing of turnouts between two routes, it does not 
yet provide a method to set-up Signal Mast logic or full interlocking.  This is envisaged to be 
developed during 2012.
