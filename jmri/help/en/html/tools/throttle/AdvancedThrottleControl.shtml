<h1>Advanced control of a throttle</h1>

<h2>Keyboard Control of the Standard Throttle Window</h2>

You can operate your JMRI throttle from the keyboard in addition to using a mouse.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
Throttles in curent Window : Alt + left/right<br>
Throttle Windows : Shift + left/right<br>
</div>
<br>
You can operate the Throttle using your keyboard (the Control Panel in the Throttle Window has to be selected):<br>

<h2>Custom Throttle with Jynstruments</h2>

<a href="../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">Jynstruments</a>
are powerful tools for creating custom JMRI throttles.
There's
<a href="../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">much more information</a>
on creating and customizing them on a 
<a href="../scripting/Jynstruments.shtml">separate page</a>.
Here, we focus on using the customized throttles.

<p>
<a href="http://jmri.org/jython/Jynstruments/ThrottleWindowToolBar/">Both
Jynstruments</a> provided below are for controlling already assigned
throttles, the Throttle Window you will control has to be set up before. 
Then it's only a matter of drag'n dropping a folder on 
the <a href="ThrottleToolBar.shtml">Throttle Window <span style="font-weight: bold;">toolbar</span></a>.
<p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note that Throttle Window content is
Jynstrumentable too, so here we drop the Jynstruments on the toolbar itself,
not on the window content.</span><br>

<a name="joypad" />
<h3>USB Joypad (USBControl.jyn)</h3>
There is a Jynstrument named USBControl.jyn to be dropped on a Throttle Window
toolbar to get control of that Window with a joypad. See the .py files for
default button settings, and possible customizations. 

<p>Particularly you might want to define a "driver" file for your own device,
start from default.py, copy it, rename it with the name of the device as seen
by JMRI without any space or ".", then use <a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/jinput/treemodel/TreeFrame.shtml">the JMRI
Jinput USB Input Control window</a> (accessible from Debug menu) to get your
Components names and value,</p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note that a classic Jython file exists to
take control of a Throttle Window with a USB device, this one is more complex
but easier to use (imho).</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Default controls:</h4>
<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Browsing throttles:</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">To browse through the curently assigned
throttles for the controlled window, the pov right and left buttons are
used. (the pov also known as switch hat, is the four or eight
directions button on the left of the pad).<br>
</div>
<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Speed:</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Speed is controlled by axis "x" which usually is found on the left stick.<br>
<br>
Note that buttons 0 to 3 (or 1 to 4) are assigned to some speed
presets, from idle (speed 0), to slow (speed 0,3), to cruise (speed
0,8), to max (speed 1). A double tap on the button for speed 0 will
send an emergency stop.<br>
</div>
<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Direction:</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Direction is controlled by axis "z" which usually is found on right left stick<br>
</div>
<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Functions buttons:</h5>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;All remaining buttons are
dedicated to functions (usually the one left on the side, under, and in
the middle of the gamepad)<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note that joypads buttons layout, and
even sticks events differ from one manufacturer to another, hance you
should customize a driver.py for your own harware.</span><br>
<br>


<a name="wii" />
<h3>Nintendo Wiimote (WiimoteThrottle.jyn)</h3>
There is a Jynstrument named WiimoteThrottle.jyn to be dropped on a Throttle
Window toolbar to get control of that Window with a Nintendo Wiimote device.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">See the .py file for </span>default button settings and<span style="font-weight: bold;"> set up.</span> (some jars are to be downloaded and copied in JMRI lib folder)<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
At the moment, none of the accelerometers of the Wiimote are used,
hence it's only a kind of deluxe remote as we only use the buttons. But
it fits very well in one hand and once you know the settings, you don't
even have to look at it to use it.<br>
<h4>Default controls:</h4>

<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Browsing throttles:</h5>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">To browse through the curently assigned
throttles for the controlled window, the left and right buttons are used.<br>
</div>

<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Speed:</h5>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Speed is controlled by buttons A (decelerate) and B (accelerate)<br>
<br>
Note that buttons 1 and 2 are used for some speed
presets, from idle (speed 0 - button 2 twice), to slow (speed 0,3 -
button 2 once), to cruise (speed 0,8 - button 1 once), to max (speed 1
- button 1 twice). Pressing buttons 1 and 2 will
send an emergency stop and vibrate the Wiimote.
</div>

<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Direction:</h5>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Direction is controlled by buttons + and -.<br>
</div>

<h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Functions buttons:</h5>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Light (function 0) is controlled by Home button.<br>
And as there is no more buttons available, no other function can be
controlled by default, but as this is a Jython script, feel free to
customize, and if somebody is able to do something with the
accelerometers, you're very welcome!<br>

<h2>iPhone and iPod Touch</h2>

There's a third-party application called
<a href="http://withrottle.com/">WiThrottle</a>
that works with JMRI let you control trains with your 
iPhone or iPod Touch.

<p>
You can also browse the
