<H1>JMRI: DecoderPro Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

<p>This page is the JMRI Decoder Pro "frequently asked questions
list". Items get listed here if they're asked a lot, even if
they're also available somewhere else.
</p>

<dl>

<dt class=left><a name="newdecoder"/>How can I get a new decoder type defined?</dt></a>
<dd class=first>
<p>
A completely new decoder needs a new or
updated configuration file.  You can 
<a href="CreateDecoder.shtml">create your own</a>
or ask on the 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">JmriUsers mailing list</a>
for somebody to create one for you.
</P>
<p>
In many cases, you can use an existing decoder that's 
"close enough".  For example, a decoder from the same
manufacturer that has a different size or current rating might
have the same configuration CVs, so it's decoder definition
would work fine.
</dd>

<dt class=left><a name="newfile"/>What do I do with this new decoder file?</dt></a>
<dd class=first>
<p>
For DecoderPro to use the definition of a decoder type in a 
new decoder file, the new file has to be included in DecoderPro's
index of decoder types. To do this:
<UL>
<LI>In your JMRI install directory, you should find a directory named "xml".
Under that directory, there should be one named "decoders".  You need to
put this file there.

<LI>Now start up DecoderPro, and open the "Debug" menu.  Select the
"Rebuild Decoder Index" option.

<LI>The computer will run for a minute or two with the selection highlighted.  
As soon as that goes away, the new definition should be available to you.

</UL>

<P>
Please make sure that the new configuration file has been contributed
to the project so it will be included in future releases, and so you
won't have to remake the index each time you update.

</dd>

<dt class=left><a name="update"/>How can I get the latest decoder
definitions?</dt></a>
<dd class=first>
<p>
The easiest way to update really is to download a new version of the program.
This is unlikely to cause problems, and automatically installs the 
latest versions of that have been contributed to DecoderPro.
<P>
Updates occur continuously between versions of the program.
As files are contributed, we make them available on our
<A HREF-"http://jmri.sourceforge.net/xml/decoders">collected decoder definitions</a>
web page. You can download them from there, but note that most
web browsers will not let you directly view them; you really
do have to download them.
<p>
While people are working on decoder definitions, they often put 
their draft definitions in the "Files" area of the 
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers">jmriusers Yahoo group</a>.
You can 
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/files/Decoder%20files">download them from there</a>.
Note that as an anti-spam measure, you will probably have to 
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/join">join the group</a>
to be able to download the files; that will require that you have a Yahoo account (free).

<dt class=left><a name="lb-xp"/>Why does my LocoBuffer-II not work in Windows XP?</dt></a>
<dd class=first>
<p>
With Windows XP, your serial port parameters might not be properly set for 
hardware flow control. To fix this, right-click on 
My Computer and select Properties. Go to the Hardware tab and click on 
Device Manager. Open up the section that says Ports (COM &amp; LPT). 
Right-click on the serial port you have the LocoBuffer hooked to and 
select Properties. Go to the Port Settings tab and set the options 
to 19200, 8, None, 1, Hardware. Click OK. Close everything. 
Restart JMRI and verify your connection settings.
