JMRI Rosters
</H2>

<P>Reading the contents of a decoder generally takes a long time, and with
some command stations it's not even possible. The JMRI Roster
stores the known values of decoder configuration values to make it
unnecessary to read them from the decoder.  It can contain "roster entries"
for an unlimited number of individual locomotives.</p>

<p>
Each roster entry has an "identifier" (ID) by which it's known.
When the program wants you to select a roster entry, it will show
a selection box or menu containing all of the roster entry IDs.
You can use anything you want for this:  Road number, type, even
"That crummy old model I need to repaint".</p>

<p>
You can edit the contents of a roster entry with the programmer panes.</p>

<H3>Roster Entry</H3>

<p>When you first open a JMRI programmer, you'll see a "Roster
Entry" pane.  On it is displayed:</p>

<dl>
<DT>ID
<dd>
The ID for this entry.  You can change it if you want, in
which case it will appear in selection boxes, etc, with the
new ID name.

<DT> Road Name
<DT> Road Number
<DT> Manufacturer
<DT> Model
<DT> Owner
<dd>
Use these for whatever you want.


<DT>DCC Address
<dd>
This is filled in based on how the decoder is configured.
You can't edit it here, so you have to go to another pane
to change the addressing.

<DT>Comment
<dd>
Use this for whatever you want.

<DT> Decoder Family
<DT> Decoder Model
<dd>
These are filled in based on the decoder that was selected when
the entry was created.  It can't be editted after that.

<DT>Decoder Comment
<dd>
You can put anything you want here.  Some people have
used it to record whether a NMRA plug was used, whether the
decoder was soldered in, etc.

<h3>Roster Menu</h3>

<a href="images/RosterMenu.jpg"><img src="images/RosterMenu.jpg" width="108" height="92" align="right"/></a>
The JMRI application main windows and the "start programmer" windows
have a "Roster" menu available.  That menu allows you to
manage the entries in your roster with commands:

<dl>

<a id="create">
<dt>Create ...
<dd>
"Create" is used to create a new roster entry, even if you
don't currently have a connection to a layout. 
When you select this, you're given a window in which to select
a decoder type. Pick the right decoder type, the format you want,
and click "Open". You'll see a DecoderPro-style window for changing the contents
of the new entry.
Don't forget to click "Save" when you're done!

<a id="edit">
<dt>Edit ...
<dd>
"Edit" is used to update the contents of a roster entry, even when you
don't have a layout connection (normally, if you do have a layout connection,
you'll use the DecoderPro programming functions).  When you select this,
you'll get a window in which to select an existing roster entry, a 
format, and an "Open" button. Once you click "Open", you'll get a 
DecoderPro-style window for viewing and changing the contents of the entry.
Don't forget to click "Save" when you're done!

<a id="copy">
<dt>Copy ...
<dd>
"Copy" is used to create another roster entry that's identical
to the original except for it's ID.  If you have a standard setup
you'd like to use for new locomotives, you can create a roster entry
with all the right values filled in, and then copy it every time you
want to program a new locomotive.

<a id="export">
<dt>Export ...
<dd>
Although it is possible to find the XML files defining roster entries
in the preferences directory, it's better not to mess with them directly.
The "Export" command will create a new file representing a roster entry,
including all of the comments, CV values, etc.  You can then take that
to another copy of DecoderPro and import it into that roster.
Export does not change your current roster in any way, it
just makes a copy for you of a specific entry.

<p>
When you select "Export ...", you be asked to select the
roster entry you want to export, then you'll be prompted to select
a new filename.  You can call it anything you want, but
it's best to put a ".xml" extension on the name.

<a id="import">
<dt>Import ...
<dd>
The combination of "Export" then "Import" allows you to bring a locomotives
roster entry when you move to another layout, with it's own DecoderPro installation.

<p>When you select "Import ...", you'll be asked to locate an XML file
to import. It should have been created by an "Export" command.  You'll
also be asked for the ID of the new roster entry to be created.
This can be the same as it was before it was exported, or you can
give it a new ID.</p>

<a id="delete">
<dt>Delete ...
<dd>
This completely removes a roster entry.  You're asked if you're sure
and a backup is made, in case of mistakes.

<a id="summary">
<dt>Print Summary ...
<dd>
This prints a summary of the entire roster, listing the primary 
information for each entry.
<p>
For a more detailed listing of a specific decoder, see the 
"File" menu on the programmer screens.

<a id="previewsummary">
<dt>Print Preview Summary ...
<dd>
This shows the contents of the printed summary on your screen,
so you can preview it before printing.
