  <h1>JMRI: Getting the Code</h1>

<em>
JMRI is migrating to Git instead of SVN for holding our code.
These instructions will work only until September 17, 2015.  
After about September 21, 2015, this page will be 
replaced by 
<a href="getgitcode.shtml">directions for using GitHub</a>.</em>

  <h2>Quickstart</h2>

  <p>You can download the most recent source code from Subversion using:
  <code><pre>
    svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/jmri/code/trunk/jmri
  </prE></code>
  </p>

  <h2>Details</h2>

  <p>Our source code is distributed using <a
  href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.  (We also keep
  the <a href="WebSite.shtml">web site</a> in Subversion, if you'd like
  to work with it directly.)  If you want to work with the code, a few
  minutes installing Subversion is well worth it.  We're sorry, but we
  just can't support other methods (sending .zip files, etc), as they're
  just too error prone.</p>

  <p>
  A few computers will come with Subversion installed, mostly various Linux
  systems.  If your computer does not have it installed, you will need
  to locate and install the needed client software.  See the
  <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html">Subversion
  binary downloads</a> page for packages for many operating systems
  (including Mac OS X, Windows and different Linux flavors).</p>

  <p>Many development environments (e.g., Netbeans or Eclipse) will have
  support for Subversion, either directly or as an add-on.  Check the
  documentation for your favorite IDE to check on SVN support.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Subversion">
  Subversion server at SourceForge</a> does not require any user
  information when you check out a copy of the code.</p>  

  <p>
  If you have an existing copy of the code and want to update it
  to the most recent contents of the Subversion repository, the command is:
  <pre>
  svn update
  </prE></p>

  <p>See also the <a href="SVNFAQ.shtml">Subversion FAQ page</a>.</p>

  <p>After the checkout is complete, you'll find a top level
  directory called <tt>java</tt>, with subdirectories <tt>xml</tt>,
  <tt>resources</tt>, <tt>jython</tt>, <tt>help</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>,
  <tt>java</tt> and others.</p>

  <p>Change to the <tt>java</tt> directory.  There, you will find a <tt>src</tt>
  directory that contains the source code for JMRI itself, and a <tt>tests</tt>
  directory that contains various test routines.</p>

  <p>You can look at the code with your favorite text editor.  To
  compile and run it, you need one of the compilation tools described
  on the bar at the left: <a href="Ant.shtml">Ant</a>, <a
   href="Eclipse.shtml">Eclipse</a>, <a
   href="NetBeans.shtml">NetBeans</a>, <a
   href="JBuilder.shtml">JBuilder</a>, etc.  (Ant may be the easiest to
  install and use, and is the primary example in the documentation)</p>

  <p>Once you're working with the code, you'll probably create some improvements
  you'd like to contribute back to the project.  This is where Subversion has tremendous
  advantages; with the appropriate permissions and commands, you can merge your
  changes back into the common source automagically.  Contact us when you're ready to
  do that or see the <a href="index.shtml#contributing">info on
  contributing</a>.</p>

  <h2>Access to Old Releases</h2>

  <p>The best way to retrieve the source for releases 2.12 and earlier
  is from the <a href="getcvscode.shtml">CVS Repository</a>.  Please
  see those instructions for details.</p>
