<H1>Integration with CATS</H1>

The Crandic Automated Traffic System (CATS) is a JMRI-based application by 
Rodney Black for controlling and operating a model railroad. 
There's more information on the 
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~kb0oys/">CATS web site</a>.

<p>
JMRI is a library, and CATS is a large, separately maintained application
that uses the library.  As such, CATS provides an important 
reference case for JMRI developers as they extend and adapt their code.
CATS should continue to work for it's users, with a minimum of extranous
effort for the CATS developers, even as JMRI changes!

<H3>Integration for testing</h3>

CATS has two package trees, "cats.*" and "developer.*", roughly
corresponding to the two CATS applications.

<p>
CATS development does not use SVN, and the code is not generally
available while it's being developed.  
Rodney Black periodoically mades releases
available, including source code, as zip-file archives at the
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Ekb0oys/">CATS web site</a>,
see the download links at the bottom of the 
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Ekb0oys/license.htm">CATS license page</a>.

<p>
As of early 2014, the current CATS distribution (2037) works
with JMRI 3.6 and current (3.7.3) test versions.  
From this baseline, we want to keep CATS compiling during
ongoing JMRI development. Changes that break CATS should be
handled through deprecation, at least for one JMRI production release.

<h3>Compiling CATS with JMRI</h3>

Download the CATS source and unpack.  You'll get a "cats" and "designer" 
directory.  (Designer is meant to be independent of JMRI, but we 
compile it together just in case)  Depending on how you unpacked, 
you might find those duplicated:  cats/cats.  Take the lowest level
"cats" and "designer" directory and move them directly under
JMRI's java/src directory, i.e. alongside the existing apps and jmri directories.

<p>
CATS doesn't have any unit tests, so there's nothing to go in the 
"test" source tree.

<p>
The Ant compilation rules will then compile CATS every time you 
compile JMRI itself. This will show you errors, deprecation warnings, etc.

<p>
To simplify SVN work, the two CATS-related directories are ignored when doing SVN operations.

<p>
Note that this does include the CATS source within the build, so any
jar files you create will also include CATS.  Don't use jar files from 
a build like this for JMRI-only purposes.

<p>
JMRI itself has lots of deprecation warnings, so if you want to see just
the CATS ones:
<ul>
<li>ant clean compile
<li>rm -r java/classes/cats java/classes/designer
<li>ant -Ddeprecation="on" compile
</ul>
The first compilation will compile everything.  The second one will only compile the
CATS source, so will only give you warnings from those classes.

<h3>From CATS from a local JMRI build</h3>

Download the most recent CATS release from the bottom of the 
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Ekb0oys/license.htm">CATS license page</a>.
As of this writing (2.2014), that was the 
&quot;<a href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Ekb0oys/release2037.zip">Executables compatible with JMRI 3.3.1</a>&quot; 
link which gives version 2037 of CATS.

<p>
Move the contents, including the startup scripts "cats.csh" (Linux, Mac OS X) and "cats.bat" (Windows)
and other related files, into your top-level JMRI directory.
<p>
If you've compiled CATS locally, you don't need the cats.jar or designer.jar files.
<p>
Then just execute the appropriate "cats.csh" (Linux, Mac OS X) and "cats.bat" (Windows) script.
