<H1>JMRI: Technology Road Map</H1>

This page is the road map for JMRI's future develpoment, 
including changes to our use of 
Java technologies.  It is maintained and updated through
continuing discussion on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=jmri-developers">jmri-developers mailing list</a>.

<p>
There's also a
<a href="TechRoadMapOlder.shtml">page containing the history</a>, particularly the saga of how we moved 
forward to Java 1.6 across a series of platform-related changes.

<h2>JMRI Releases</h2>

This section describes the (notional)
plans for JMRI releases in the future.
<!--<P>
Note that there's been no decision on when a "4.0" version is warranted, so these are described as 3.* numbers.
In the past, we went from 2.13 (test) to 2.14 (production) to 2.99 (test) to 3.0 (production), so that numbering
system might be used again.-->

<h4>JMRI 3.9, 3.10 (End of 2014)</h4>

The JMRI 3.9 development series will stay with Java 1.6 for JRE and SDK. 

<h4>JMRI 3.11, 4.0 (Summer 2015)</h4>

For multiple reasons including
<ul>
<li>Improved performance, particularly of web I/O and XML file loading, and
<li>Language and library improvements that made the developer's work easier,
</ul>
the Spring 2015 series of test releases (JMRI 3.11.*) will require
Java 1.8 for both building and running. 
Java 1.8 will also be required for the Summer 2015 production release.

<p>Planned JMRI changes that affect backwards-compatibility:
<ul>
<li>Planned removal of XmlIO web service.
<li>Removal of deprecated InstanceManager methods
<li>Removal of some deprecated pass-through classes
</ul>

<p>
New library features
(subject to verification):
<ul>
<li>Update to JDOM 2 for efficiency and coding convenience
<li>Update Jython to at least 2.5.4 (bug fixes), 
    and depending on compatibility testing, perhaps 2.7.* (for modern Python)
<li>Start using <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305">JSR 305 annotations</a> 
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/findbugs/">via Findbugs</a>
    to strengthen the code checking (see 
        <a href="https://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/09/11/jsr-305-annotations.html">this</a> and
        <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/api/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/annotations/package-summary.html">this</a>.
<li>JUnit to the current <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit 4 release</a>, currently 4.12.
Among other improvements, this will allow use of the 
Java <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3806173/assert-keyword-in-java">assert keyword</a>. We'll
need to establish some conventions for how to use that.
</ul>

<h4>JMRI after Summer 2015</h4>

The series of test releases in Fall 2015 is expected to continue with Java 1.8
and the same set of included libraries.  Any changes to that plan will be noted here.

<p>At some point, we have to migrate away from 
<a href="Help.shtml">JavaHelp and JHelpDev</a>.
At a minimum, we'll need to
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brinkley/archive/2004/11/javahelp_v20_02.html">replace the renderer</a>.
There are 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9900110/javahelp-viewers-or-alternatives">several alternative help systems</a> available.
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/index-083946.html">Oracle Help</a>
might be a good choice.


<h3>Java Release and Operating System Support</h3>

More information on Java releases and the operating systems
that support them is on a 
<a href="JVMCapabilities.shtml">separate page</a>.

<h2>Migration Notes</h2>

This is a section of notes for various code migrations that are in progress
or contemplated.

<h3 id="jdom2">From JDOM 1 to JDOM 2</h3>

JMRI 3.11 moved from JDOM version 1 to JDOM version 2.  This involved
a new jdom-2.0.5.jar file (in place of the earlier jdom.jar), changes to 
startup and build control files, and some required code changes:
<ul>
<li>JDOM 2 classes are in the org.jdom2 package instead of org.jdom.  This 
required some changes to import statements and class-references in the source code.
<li>The default output formatting is different, requiring minor changes in e.g. the XmlFile
class output routines.
</ul>

In addition, JDOM 2 uses generics in it's input parameters and return values.  This
means you can remove (now redundant) casts in many places.  Jenkins will warn about those.
