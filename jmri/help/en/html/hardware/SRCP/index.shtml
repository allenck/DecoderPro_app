JMRI: Configuring SRCP Connection

SRCP support will be available in
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/releasenotes/jmri2.1.6.shtml">JMRI 2.1.6</a>.
<p>

The
<a href="http://srcpd.sourceforge.net/">SRCP protocol</a>
was created by the 
<a href="http://www.der-moba.de/index.php/Hauptseite">der Moba</a>
model railroad group as a standard way of connecting
"client" user programs to a "server", which in turn connects to the 
model railroad.  There are a number of model railroad
SRCP servers available, which in turn can currently connect to the layout via
Intellibox and Marklin 605x control units and the Lenz interfaces.
There is also a server available that can directly create DCC signals
via an RS232 inteface, which DCC booster(s) can then use to power the layout.
Other SRCP demons with other connections are being developed all the time.

<p>
The initial JMRI support allows JMRI to connection to a layout through a
SRCP server.  JMRI can then operate Turnouts, Lights and SignalHeads that
can be reached via SRCP.  There is also initial support for 
JMRI Throttles via SRCP.

<h2>Configuring JMRI</h2>

To use an SRCP connection, select "SRCP Server" as a protocol under the preferences.
<p>
Next fill in the Internet address for the SRCP server.  This can be numbers like 127.0.0.1 or 
a name like "srcp.sf.net".  A server running on the same computer can usually be referred to as "localhost".
<p>
Then fill in the port number.  This can be obtained from the configuration for your SRCP server.
<p>
Finally, save the preferences and restart the program.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

SRCP support was introduced in JMRI 2.1.6 during the Spring of 2008.  
That version has several limitations:
<ul>
<li>It does not support "service mode" for configuring decoders, e.g. setting CVs.
<li>It needs lots more testing, especially with Marklin and other non-DCC systems.
</ul>

<h2>More Information</h2>

There's a lot of good information on SRCP and how it fits into an
overall model-railroad system
