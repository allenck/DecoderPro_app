<H1>JMRI Hardware Guide: Using a USB to Serial adapter</H1>


<P>If your model railroad hardware is supposed to connect to a
computer via a traditional RS232 serial connection, but your computer
doesn't have any RS232 ports, what do you do? This is becoming more
common as new computers are sold with USB ports instead of RS232 serial
ports.</P>
<P>One solution is to use a "USB to Serial" adapter to solve this. A
typical unit is the 
<A HREF="http://www.tripplite.com/en/products/model.cfm?txtmodelid=3914">Keyspan USA-19HS series of adapters</A>
by Tripplite. 
We recommend these Keyspan adapters; we use a
Keyspan 19-series adapter during the release testing, and have found
them to work reliably in all cases so far.</P>
<P>Other companies, such as <A HREF="http://www.belkin.com">Belkin</A>,
market adapters under their own name, and you can often find off-brand
adapters at your local computer store.</P>
<P>Before you buy any adapter, make sure that it will work with your
particular computer and operating system version. The important issue
here is the "drivers" the computer needs to talk to the hardware
adapter; some adapter manufacturers only provide Windows drivers, which
makes their products useless to a Macintosh or Linux user. Also note
that MacOS 8/9 and Mac OS X drivers are different, and can't be
interchanged.</P>
<P>Many DCC systems don't require very much of their serial ports,
and in that case any adapter will probably work. But some DCC systems
require either special baud rates and/or RS232 control leads that not
all adapters can provide. The rest of this page addresses those special
cases.</P>

<A NAME="MS100">
<H2>LocoNet via MS100 adapter</H2></A>

The MS100 requires a special baud rate that most USB to serial adapters
can't provide. It also requires power to be supplied via the RS232
control leads.
<P>The Keyspan 19HS adapters are known to work with the MS100. We've
gotten reports of success from Windows 98, Windows XP, and MacOS 9
users. 
(Note that the MS100 doesn't work with Mac OS X or many Windows Vista machines; 
this is not a USB adapter issue) You'll have to get a special cable to connect the 9-pin
connector on the Keyspan adapter to the 25-pin connector on the MS100.</P>
<P>Note that using a LocoBuffer is highly recommended instead of
trying to get a MS100 to work!</P>
<P>There are other Keyspan USB adapters who are known to not work
with the MS100. In particular, the Macintosh Dual Serial adapter which
provides two Macintosh DIN-8 serial ports does not provide the power
needed by the MS100. <A HREF="loconet/KeyspanUSB.shtml">(More details)</A></P>
<P>Users have reported that a Belkin adapter wouldn't work with a
MS100 because it could not provide the special baud rate needed.</P>

<A NAME="LocoBuffer">
<H2>LocoNet via LocoBuffer, LocoBuffer-II</H2></A>

<P>If you haven't yet purchased a LocoBuffer, you're best bet is ordering a 
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">LocoBuffer-USB</A>
from <A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-Cirkits</A>
This has a native USB connection to your computer, so no 
USB-to-Serial adapter is needed.</P>

<p>
For reliable operation, the serial LocoBuffer interfaces require that
the RS232 control leads provide flow control.

<P>The Keyspan adapters are also known to work with the LocoBuffer.
We've gotten reports of success from Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows XP
and Mac OS X users. You'll have to get a special cable to connect
the 9-pin connector on the Keyspan adapter to the 25-pin connector on
the original LocoBuffer; later models have a 9-pin serial connector.</P>
<P>We have also had a report that the "IConcepts" adapter, purchased
at CompUSA, works with Windows ME and Windows XP.</P>
<P>All adapters based on the "FTDI FT232BM chip" should work fine.
This includes the UN8E adapter provided
by <A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-Cirkits</A>, and many
do-it-yourself adapters. If you're using this adapter with a Macintosh
or Linux computer, be sure to download the most recent drivers from the
<A HREF="http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm">FTDI</A> website, as
early versions had bugs.</P>

<A NAME="LI100">
<H2>XpressNet via LI100</H2></A>

For reliable operation, the LI100 XpressNet interface requires that the
RS232 control leads provide flow control.

<P>The Keyspan adapters are known to work with the LI100. We've
gotten reports of success from Windows 98, Windows XP, MacOS 9 and MacOS
X users.</P>
<A NAME="LI101">
<H2>XpressNet via LI101</H2></A>

For reliable operation, the LI101 XpressNet interface requires that the
RS232 control leads provide flow control.

<P>As yet, we've received no reports or success or failure from
people using an LI101 with a USB to serial adapter. More information
would be greatly appreciated. <!--#include virtual="/Footer" --></P>
