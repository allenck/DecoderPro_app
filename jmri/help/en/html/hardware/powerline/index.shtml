<h2> 
JMRI:  Powerline Controllers
</h2>

This page talks about how to configure JMRI to talk
to powerline controllers, e.g. X10, Insteon. 

<p>
See also the associated
<a href="Compatibility.shtml">compatibility page</a> to see what interfaces
have been supported.

<p>
For information on how to address your equipment via JMRI, please
see the 
<a href="Names.shtml">page on addressing and JMRI names</a> for X10.

<p>
JMRI Lights work intuitively with powerline devices.  When the JMRI
Light is set "ON", a command is send to the remote device to set it "ON".
Ditto for "OFF". 

<p>
There's also limited support for dimming (variable brightness) Lights.
See the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/simplelightctrl/SimpleLightCtrl.shtml">"Light Control" page</a> 
for more information on this.

<p>
JMRI Turnouts are available for X10.  When the JMRI Turnout
is set to "THROWN", a command is sent to the remote device to 
set it to "BRIGHT".  This is an immediate, full-power on.  When the Turnout
is set to "CLOSED", the remote device is sent a command to go "OFF".  Depending
on the X10 hardware, this may be either an immediate off, or be slowly dimmed.
