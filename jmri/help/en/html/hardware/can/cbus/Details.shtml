<h1> 
JMRI: CBUS Support Technical Details
</h1>

<em>The support on this page is rapidly evolving; the
actual code might be ahead or behind the documentation
on any given day.</em><p>

This page describes technical details of JMRI's
<a href="index.shtml">CBUS</a>
support.  See also the pages on JMRI's 
<A href="../index.shtml">general CAN support</a>.
<p>

<h2>CAN Adapters</h2>

JMRI's general approach is to support as many 
hardware combinations as possible. By supporting as many 
people and their hardware desires as possible, we 
can create a growing community of developers, hence more
code.

<P>
As part of this, the JMRI CAN support is designed to
use as many CAN adapter types as possible.

<P>
The MERG CAN-RS can do "enumeration" for CBUS, but 
many other adapters can't 
because of their intrinsic latency.
Their slow replies effectively make them invisible.  

<P>
Therefore, Mike Bolton , one of the the CBUS developers
suggested that
JMRI use a CBUS ID of 126.  Currently, that's a fixed value.
