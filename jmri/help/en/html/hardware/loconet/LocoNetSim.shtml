      <h1> 
      JMRI Hardware Guide: LocoNet&reg; Simulator
      </h1>

If JMRI is configured to use a Digitrax LocoNet&reg; connection, but
the connection isn't available, several aspects of the program will
not function.  This is because the program needs to interact with
the LocoNet during normal operation, and without the expected responses
from the LocoNet it will appear basically dead.
<P>
The "LocoNet Simulator" was created to make it possible to use JMRI
in a disconnected mode.  This is useful e.g. if you want to develop
a panel while away from your layout.
<P>
To use the LocoNet Simulator, select it as your layout connection in the
preferences, save the preferences, quit and restart the program.  You should
then be able to access LocoNet items such as Turnouts, Sensors, Signals, etc.
Some of the more advanced features, such as the BDL168 programmer, will 
not fully function, but you should be able to do all the steps to build
and edit panels.
<P>
When your computer is connected to the LocoNet again, you can change the
preferences to the proper connection, e.g. a LocoBuffer-USB, and use the panel
you've created.

<h2>Hex files</h2>
The simulator can also read and playback hex traces of LocoNet activity
to see how the program will react to them.  Each line in the trace is a 
single LocoNet packet in hexadecimal characters.  You can create one of these
by for example turning on the "show raw data" option in a LocoNet Monitor window, and
having the monitor write to a log file. You'll have to edit the 
resulting file to remove the human readable lines, leaving just the
hex raw data.

An example hex file is shown here:

    
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">A1&nbsp;0B&nbsp;00&nbsp;55&nbsp;&crarr;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">B0&nbsp;2D&nbsp;10&nbsp;72&nbsp;&crarr;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">BB&nbsp;10&nbsp;00&nbsp;54&nbsp;&crarr;</span></p>
<p>Note that each hex value must be two valid hexadecimal characters plus a space.  Each
message (line) must be terminated by a carriage return.  Note that there is a 
space immediately before the carriage return!</p>
<p>The sequence above would result in the following LocoNet traffic, shown as decoded 
    by the LocoNet Monitor tool (with Raw Data displayed):</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">[A1 0B 00 55]  Set loco in slot 11 direction to FWD, F0=Off, F1=Off, F2=Off, F3=Off, F4=Off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">[B0 2D 10 72]  Requesting Switch at LT46 () to Thrown (output On).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace">[BB 10 00 54]  Request data/status for slot 16.</span></p>
<p>Because there is no Command Station, the last message would not receive a response.
