      JMRI Hardware Guide: Connecting a LocoBuffer to LocoNet&reg;
      </h1>


<p>
John Jabour designed the LocoBuffer as a reliable way of connecting
a computer to a LocoNet&reg;.  He's no longer making them, but 
<A HREF="http://users.pandora.be/deloof/page5.html">Hans deLoof</a>
has taken over for people who want to build their own.
</p>
<p>
The 
<A HREF="LocoBufferII.shtml">LocoBuffer II</a>
is currently the most reliable commercially-available way to 
connect a computer to a LocoNet.  It is produced by Dick Bronson's
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a> 
company, based in part on the original LocoBuffer design.
</p>


<h2>Recommended setup</h2>
<p>
The recommended setup for the LocoBuffer is:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>The LocoBuffer should be configured with J1, J4 and J5 set on
pins 1 and 2, J2 and J3 set to pins 2 and 3. This configures it
for a 19,200 baud connection, with echo on.
<LI>
Start DecoderPro or other program and configure it for:
<UL>
<LI>LocoNet LocoBuffer
<LI>Select your port
<LI>19,200 baud
<LI>Hardware flow control
</UL>
</UL>

<h2>Usage suggestions</h2>

 <P> For the most reliable operation, turn on your layout and
 computer before you turn on the LocoBuffer.</p>

	  <P> Some computers can successfully communicate at 57,600bps with
	  a LocoBuffer.  To do this, select "57,600 baud" when configuring
	  and configure your LocoBuffer with J4 and J5 set on pins 1 and 2,
	  J1, J2 and J3 set to pins 2 and 3 (J1 is the one that determines
	  the baud rate).  But we strongly recommend that you try 19,200
	  and make sure that works first.</p>

	  <P>The LocoBuffer controller chip should contain version 1.4.6 or
	  later of the LocoBuffer program. Note that LocoBuffer version
	  1.4.5 has a bug that prevents it from working with this program.
	  If you got your LocoBuffer chip after February 2002, this should
	  not be a problem for you.</p>

<h2><A NAME="flow">LocoBuffer flow control</a></h2>

	  <p>Some Windows versions, in particular Win2000, cannot handle
	  the LocoBuffer's control leads properly.  You'll see this as
	  DecoderPro or PanelPro being unable to communicate with the
	  command station, even though you can see LocoNet traffic with the
	  LocoNet monitor.  To fix this, try opening the preferences and
	  select "no flow control" option, click save, then quit and
	  restart the program.  Note that this problem is specific to
	  certain Windows versions, and you generally should have "hardware
	  flow control" selected.  </p>

	  <P> If the problem persists, please try jumpering-together the
	  pins 5, 6 and 8 on the LocoBuffer's 25-pin connector.  These are
	  the CTS, DSR, and DCD leads in the LocoBuffers RS232 interface,
	  and connecting them will (perhaps) fool your computer into
	  accepting the LocoBuffers flow control signals.</p>

	  <p> That connector has a row of 12 pins and a row of 13.  Looking
	  at the solder-side of the board, pin 1 is at the end of the row
	  of 13 (toward the center of the board), at the end nearest the
	  RJ12 LocoNet jack.  Next to that are pins 2, 3, 4 and 5 with
	  traces on them.    Pin 6 is next to that, with nothing connected.
	  Pin 7 (ground) has a trace, then pin 8 does not.</p>

	  <P> So the suggestion is to connect pin 5 (with a trace) to pin 6
	  and 8 (without traces).  Be careful not to short to pin 7, which
	  is already connected.  </p>
