      JMRI Hardware Guide: Connecting an MS100 to LocoNet&reg;
      </h1>


<p>
The MS100 from Digitrax allows you to connect many types of computers
to a LocoNet&reg;. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the MS100 is a somewhat old design, and doesn't
provide a reliable connection to the LocoNet.
<ul>
<li>Your computer may not be able to connect through the MS100.
<li>Even if it the MS100 makes a connection, you are likely to encounter hard-to-diagnose intermittent errors.  
<li>Even if you get the MS100 to work once, it may permanently fail due to an update to the computer operating system.
<li>If you have problems with an MS100, there may not be anybody who can help you with them.
</ul>
We strongly recommend that new setups not use the MS100, and existing users 
plan on converting to a better solution before it becomes necessary. 

<p>The 
<A HREF="LocoBufferUSB.shtml">LocoBuffer USB</a>
and the <A HREF="PR3.shtml">Digitrax PR3</a>
are currently the most reliable ways to 
connect a computer to a LocoNet.  
The LocoBuffer-USB is produced by Dick Bronson's
<A HREF="http://www.rr-cirkits.com">RR-CirKits</a> 
company, based in part on the original LocoBuffer design.
</p>


<p>In MS100 mode, the program attempts to open the port at 16600
baud, the LocoNet rate.  If this fails, it attempts to open the
port at 16457 baud, which is a standard rate that's close enough
to work.  If this also fails, the won't be able to talk to the 
LocoNet through the MS100.
<p>
Because neither of these rates are available, <b>the MS100 can't be
used with Mac OS X, Windows 7 or most Windows Vista machines</b>.  
<p>
Because we can't be sure your computer
will be able to talk to a MS100 without trying it, you should
test this before spending money on the MS100. To do that:</p>
<UL>
    <LI>Start the program.</li>
    <LI>Set the preferences for MS100 and your serial port. You
    don't need to have anything connected, but do select the port
    you will eventually be using. </li>
    <LI>Save the preferences.</li>
    <LI>Quit the program and restart it so that the preferences
    take effect.</li>
</UL>

<p>If you get a dialog box saying "Could not set baud rate...",
then you won't be able to use your computer with a MS100.  You
should use a LocoBuffer.</p>

<h3>Linux hack to set the baud rate</h3>

Some users have reported success using Linux commands to 
directly set the baud rate while the program is running.  To do this:
<UL>
<LI>Start DecoderPro,
and wait until you see the error message that the baud rate could
not be set. 
<LI>Run the following commands from the Linux command line:
<PRE>
setserial /dev/ttyS0 divisor 7
setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_cust
stty speed 38400 &lt; /dev/ttyS0
</PRE>
<LI>Then click on "OK" and continue on. 
</UL>

This has been reported to work
with both RH9 and FC3.
