<H1>JMRI: DS54 Examples</H1>
<p class=subtitle> Examples of using a Digitrax DS54 with JMRI. </p>
<p>
The DS54 accessory decoder can be configured in a large number of
ways.  
(<a href="../../../manual/index.shtml">DecoderPro</a> can help with that)

<P>
Walter Thompson walked through the details of this:

<P>
With the DS54 at defaults these are the LocoNet&reg; msgs when either Switch A
or Aux A goes positive causing the Turnout to "toggle" state:
<BR>
When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70 35].
<BR>
When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50 15]

<P>
I then set "When Switch A input changes, send" ="Turnout feedback msg"
<BR>
When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70 36]
<BR>
When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50 15]

<P>
I then set "When Aux A input changes, send"= "Turnout feedback message"
<BR>
When Switch A (blue lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 70 36]
<BR>
When Aux A (orange lead) goes high loconet msg [b2 8 50 16]

<P>
Therefore, when the Switch and Aux inputs are set to send a turnout 
feedback message, the feedback mechanisms built into recent versions
of JMRI can be used to track the turnout state when the local
inputs are used to change the turnout.

<h2>Exact Feedback</h2>

<p>To use exact feedback, you need to connect two microswitches to the 
turnout and to the Switch and Aux inputs on the DS54.
(You can use the built in Tortoise contacts for this)</p>
<P>
Configure the DS54 channel with:
<PRE>
 Aux A input"='Active ON, trigger on change, Positive Level"
 Aux A task"="No Output change"
 When Aux A input changes, send"= "Exact turnout feedback message"
 Switch A input"='Active ON, trigger on change, Positive Level"
 Switch A task"="No Output change"
 Switch A input changes, send"= "Exact turnout feedback message"
</PRE>
<p>Configure Turnout LT9 (via the Turnout Table) to use "EXACT" feedback.</p>
<P>

<H1>Programming the DS54</H1>
<p>The DS54 CV values can be programmed via JMRI using the JMRI programming tools
    using the "Service Mode" programming track.  This requires a JMRI connection
    to a command station, and the DS54's track inputs must be connected to the
    programming track.  As described in the DS54 documentation, it is necessary to 
    connect a 100 Ohm 2 Watt resistor between one of the programming track 
    rails and the "Yellow" input wire of one of the DS54's output connectors.  
    It is also necessary to disconnect all other input signal sources.</p>
<p>Once the connections described above have been made, place the programming 
    jumper across the programming jumper pins and open the JMRI "Service-Mode 
    Programmer" tool.  Navigate to the "Digitrax" entry, and select DS54 as the
    decoder type, and press the "Open Programmer" button.  You may then read and
    write the CVs just like any mobile decoder.</p>    
<p>When ready to place the DS54 back in normal service, disconnect the programming
    track connections and programming resistor, and be sure to remove the 
    programming jumper.</p>

<H1>DS54 Wiring</H1>
<p>It is strongly recommended that when multiple DS54s are used, that they be
    connected to the track wires with consistent phasing.  In other words, all
    DS54 devices should connect the RailA connection to the same terminal position
    on the DS54, and that all DS54s connect the RailB connection to the <i>other</i>
    terminal position.  This is important to ensure that there is not an unexpected
    current flow on the LocoNet cable due to out-of-phase connections on the
    DS54 track connections.  Note that this means that the DS54 track connections
    should <i>not</i> be made using track power that is from an <i>autoreversing</i>
    power district.</p>
<p>Technical details on this issue can be found in <a href="DigitraxPower/index.shtml"> a discussion of
        power leads on Digitrax components</a>.</p>
